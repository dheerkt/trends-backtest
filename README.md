# trends-backtest
For the Fall 2021 Intermediate Investments (COMM 4710) class with Prof. Steven Baker at UVA, we had to create and backtest an Active Management strategy for the [Harvard Management Company (2010) case](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=39330). I explored a portfolio optimization strategy based on Google Trends data. This repository contains the code and data used to backtest the strategy, along with a short memo summarizing the strategy performance.

* Strategy analysis memo available in [memo.md](https://github.com/dheerkt/trends-backtest/blob/master/memo.md).
* Documented code snippets available in GitHub Markdown [backtest.md](https://github.com/dheerkt/trends-backtest/blob/master/backtest.md).
* Full code is available in [backtest.Rmd](https://github.com/dheerkt/trends-backtest/blob/master/backtest.Rmd).
